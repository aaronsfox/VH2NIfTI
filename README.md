# VH2NIfTI

This GitHub repository contains code to convert raw Visible Human images to
NIfTI files that can be used in most image processing software.

Getting the data:

The code expects unzipped .raw files to be in a folder with the following
structure:
<main_path>/male/fullcolor/fullbody
<main_path>/female/fullcolor/fullbody

The Visible Human data is freely available. 
Information about downloading the raw data can be found here:

Make sure to unzip the raw images (e.g. using 7-zip) before using this code.
